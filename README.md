# hi.

### 

i'm a 19-year-old software engineer from edmonton, alberta, canada.  i've been programming since age ~13.  
i main a beautiful **2019 macbook pro 16"** with the amazing **hyper.sh** terminal, **vscode**, and **intellij**.  

i enjoy writing websites in **Vue.js** using static/ssr/spa frameworks like **Nuxt.js** or JAMstack with **Gridsome**.  
**kotlin** is my favourite language right now, and i'm in the process of learning **rust**.  

devops, infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and serverless are all huge topics of interest for me at the moment, and i'm trying to improve my knowledge and skills with kubernetes, terraform, docker, and serverless platforms like cloudflare workers.

...1v1 me in rocket league
